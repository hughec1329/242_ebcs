abstract = {Body condition score (BCS) is considered an important tool for management of dairy cattle. The feasibility of estimating the BCS from digital images has been demonstrated in recent work. Regression machines have been successfully employed for automatic BCS estimation, taking into account information of the overall shape or information extracted on anatomical points of the shape. Despite the progress in this research area, such studies have not addressed the problem of modeling the shape of cows to build a robust descriptor for automatic BCS estimation. Moreover, a benchmark data set of images meant as a point of reference for quantitative evaluation and comparison of different automatic estimation methods for BCS is lacking. The main objective of this study was to develop a technique that was able to describe the body shape of cows in a reconstructive way. Images, used to build a benchmark data set for developing an automatic system for BCS, were taken using a camera placed above an exit gate from the milking robot. The camera was positioned at 3 m from the ground and in such a position to capture images of the rear, dorsal pelvic, and loin area of cows. The BCS of each cow was estimated on site by 2 technicians and associated to the cow images. The benchmark data set contained 286 images with associated BCS, anatomical points, and shapes. It was used for quantitative evaluation. A set of example cow body shapes was created. Linear and polynomial kernel principal component analysis was used to reconstruct shapes of cows using a linear combination of basic shapes constructed from the example database. In this manner, a cow's body shape was described by considering her variability from the average shape. The method produced a compact description of the shape to be used for automatic estimation of BCS. Model validation showed that the polynomial model proposed in this study performs better (error=0.31) than other state-of-the-art methods in estimating BCS even at the extreme values of BCS scale.},

abstract = {Body condition scoring, an indirect measure of the level of subcutaneous fat in dairy cattle, has been widely adopted for research and field assessment or for management purposes on farms. The feasibility of utilizing digital images to determine body condition score (BCS) was assessed for lactating dairy cows at the Scottish Agricultural College Crichton Royal Farm. Two measures of BCS were obtained by using the primary systems utilized in the United Kingdom (UK-BCS) and the United States (USBCS). Means were 2.12 (+/-0.35) and 2.89 (+/-0.40), modes were 2.25 and 2.75, and ranges were 1.0 to 3.5 and 1.5 to 4.5 for the UKBCS (n = 2,346) and USBCS (n = 2,571), respectively. Up to 23 anatomical points were manually identified on images captured automatically as cows passed through a weigh station. Points around the hooks were easier to identify on images than points around pins and the tailhead. All identifiable points were used to define and formulate measures describing the cow's contour. For both BCS systems, hook angle, posterior hook angle, and tailhead depression were significant predictors of BCS. When the full data set testing only the angles around the hooks was used, 100\% of predicted BCS were within 0.50 points of actual USBCS and 92.79\% were within 0.25 points; and 99.87\% of predicted BCS were within 0.50 points of actual UKBCS and 89.95\% were within 0.25 points. In a reduced data set considering only observations in which the tailhead depression angle was available, adding the tailhead depression to models did not improve model predictions. The relationships of the calculated angles with USBCS were stronger than those with UKBCS. This research demonstrates the potential for using digital images for assessing BCS. Future efforts should explore ways to automate this process by using a larger number of animals to predict scores accurately for cows across all levels of body condition.},

abstract = {Two body condition scoring systems were compared for assessing body condition of cows at the Scottish Agricultural College's Crichton Royal Farm. The weekly body condition scores (BCS) were collected for a period of 12 weeks (5 September-21 November). Scores were obtained using the primary systems utilized within the UK and USA. The USBCS were obtained by the same evaluator each week, while the UKBCS were obtained by two different evaluators alternating between weeks. Paired scores (n=2088) between the two systems within week were moderately correlated (r=0.75, P<0.0001). Regression equations to convert scores between the two systems were created using the GLM procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC, USA). The simple GLM models to convert from UK to US scores and US to UK scores were USBCS=1.182+0.816 * UKBCS (R2=0.56) and UKBCS=0.131+0.681 (R2=0.56), respectively. These equations may be used to interpret scores within the literature obtained using these two BCS systems, although they must be used with caution.},

abstract = {Relationships among milk production, body condition score (BCS), body weight (BW), and reproduction were studied using logistic regression on data from 6433 spring-calving Holstein-Friesian dairy cows in 74 commercial herds. Multivariate models were adjusted for herd, breeding value for milk yield, proportion of Holstein-Friesian genes, lactation number, calving period, and degree of calving assistance. Significant associations between reproductive measures and components of energy balance were identified. Higher 200-d milk protein content and higher protein-to-fat ratio at start of breeding were associated with increased likelihood of submission for breeding in the first 21 d of the breeding season (SR21). High 100-d cumulative milk yield as a proportion of estimated 305-d milk yield (low persistency) was associated with a lower likelihood of pregnancy to first service (PREG1), whereas cows reaching peak milk yields earlier tended to have higher PREG1. Cows that reached nadir milk protein content relatively late in lactation had lower PREG1. Milk yield at first service and 305-d milk protein content were positively associated with the likelihood of pregnancy after 42 d of breeding (PR42). Higher 305-d milk lactose content was associated with increased PREG1 and PR42. Mean BCS at 60 to 100 d of lactation was positively associated with both SR21 and PR42, whereas nadir BCS was positively associated with PREG1. Cows with precalving BCS > 3.0 that also lost > 0.5 BCS unit by first service had lower PR42. More BW gain for 90 d after start of breeding was associated with higher SR21 and PREG1; more BW gain for 90 d after first service was associated with higher PR42. Milk protein and lactose content, BCS, and BW changes are important tools to identify cows at risk of poor reproduction.},

abstract = {Infrared thermography (IRT) absorbs infrared radiation and generates images based on the amount of heat generated. It has been used in human medicine for diagnosis of various cancers. This experiment was conducted to determine if IRT had merit for early detection of subclinical mastitis in dairy cows. Milk sample and skin surface temperature (SST) were simultaneously evaluated using the California Mastitis Test (CMT) and IRT for each quarter in 94 dairy cows (49 Brown Swiss and 45 Holstein). Average days in milk (DIM) and milk production were 93 +/- 37 d and 16 +/- 2.2 kg (mean +/- SD) and their ages ranged from 4 to 8 yr. There was a strong correlation between SST and CMT score (r = 0.92). Average SST was 33.19, 34.08, 34.99, and 36.15 degrees C for quarters with the CMT score of 0 (n = 156), +1 (n = 116), +2 (n = 80), and +3 (n = 24), respectively. This association was best described by a linear model as follows: y = 0.94x + 33.17, R(2) = 0.85, where y = SST and x = CMT score. Changes in rectal temperature (RT) due to the CMT score were minor (y = 0.09x + 38.39, R(2) = 0.07, where y = RT and x = average CMT score). In conclusion, RT may not confirm mastitis. However, IRT is sensitive enough to perceive changes in SST in response to varying degrees of severity of the mammary gland infection as reflected by the CMT score, suggesting that as a noninvasive tool, IRT can be employed for screening dairy cows for mastitis.},

abstract = {The use of the calving index as a measure of herd fertility ignores the proportion of the herd that is culled, generally for failing to conceive. It is more important to consider the total cost of long calving intervals, high culling rate and even low pregnancy rates in an integrated index that reflects inefficient management, than to have to cope with balancing a number of separate physical indicators. In a study of 91 herds containing 14,524 cows a full range of physical indices was examined. The average herd calving interval was 380.3 days, with a culling rate of 23.1 per cent. Of the cows calving, 76.9 per cent recalved, a figure which when adjusted for the calving interval (CIA calving rate) became 73.8 per cent. In quartiles split on the basis of CIA calving rate, the top quartile achieved 82 per cent with a calving index of 375.2, and a culling rate of 16.7 per cent. These standards were achieved by serving 91.9 per cent of the cows after calving, at an interval to first service of 67.2 days. The submission rate for artificial insemination in the first 24 days after the earliest service date was 57.5 per cent and the overall pregnancy rate was 51.2 per cent. As a result 92.1 per cent of the cows served, and 85.3 per cent of those which calved, conceived again, with an average of 1.9 services per conception. Assessing fertility on a financial basis, with costs attributed to calving interval, culling rate and pregnancy rate to give a fertility index, the average herd was losing pounds 62/cow/year, compared with target levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The hypothesis tested was that the body shape of a fatter cow is rounder than that of a thin cow and, therefore, may better fit a parabolic shape. An image-processing model was designed that calculates a parameter to assess body shape. The model was implemented, and its outputs were validated against ultrasonic and thermal camera measurements of the thickness of fat and muscle layers, and manual body condition scoring of 186 Holstein-Friesian cows. The thermal camera overcomes some of the drawbacks of a regular camera; the hooks and the tailhead nadirs of a thin cow diverged from the parabolic shape. The correlation between thermal camera's measurements and fat and muscle thickness was 0.47. Mean body condition scorings were 2.18, 2.15, and 2.23, with no significant difference found across the assessment methods. Further research is needed to achieve fully automatic, accurate body condition scoring.},

Further development of the computer model could aid interpretation of DHIA data by dairy record processing centers and herd consultants. This diagnostic module was developed with an artificial neural network, a technology that processes complex data in a manner similar to human brain function. Information describing herd management practices, quarter milk samples, and monthly DHIA data was collected from Pennsylvania dairy herds with moderate to high somatic cell counts. This information was used to develop or train an artificial neural network model that discriminated among four categories of bacterial organisms (contagious, environmental, no significant growth, and other) associated with clinical and subclinical mastitis. After training the model, new DHIA and management data were presented to the model to assess its ability to classify bacteriological etiology. When the artificial neural network was used, the probabilities of diagnosing the bacteriologic status from three randomly selected cow groups and from new untested herds ranged from 57 to 71\%. Performance of the artificial neural network model was best in herds with higher frequency of minor and contagious pathogens. Prediction results for the same test data with linear discriminant analysis were less successful, ranging from 42 to 57\%.},

abstract = {Lying behavior in dairy cattle can provide insight into how cows interact with their environment. Although lying behavior is a useful indicator of cow comfort, it can be time consuming to measure. In response to these time constraints, using data loggers to automate behavioral recording has become increasingly common. We tested the accuracy of the Onset Pendant G data logger (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA) for measuring lying behavior in dairy cattle (n=24 cows; 12 in each of 2 experiments). Cows wore the logger on the lateral (experiment 1) or medial (experiment 2) side of the hind leg above the metatarsophalangeal joint. Loggers recorded behavior at 4 sampling intervals (6, 30, 60, and 300 s) for at least 1.5 d. Data were smoothed using 3 editing methods to examine the effects of short, potentially erroneous readings. For this purpose, Microsoft Excel macros (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) converted readings (i.e., lying events bordered by standing or vice versa) occurring singly or in consecutive runs of ≤2 or ≤6. Behavior was simultaneously recorded with digital video equipment. The logger accurately measured lying and standing. For example, predictability, sensitivity, and specificity were >99\% using 30-s sampling and the single-event filter compared with continuously scored video recordings. The 6- and 30-s sampling intervals were comparable for all aspects of lying behavior when short events were filtered from the data set. Estimates of lying time generated from the 300-s interval unfiltered regimen were positively related (R(2) ≥ 0.99) to estimates of lying time from video, but this sampling regimen overestimated the number of lying bouts. This is likely because short standing and lying bouts were missed (12 and 34\% of lying and standing bouts were <300 s in experiment 1 and 2, respectively). In summary, the data logger accurately measured all aspects of lying behavior when the sampling interval was ≤30 s and when short readings of lying and standing were filtered from the data set.},

abstract = {A 4-balance system for measuring the leg-load distribution of dairy cows during milking to detect lameness was developed. Leg weights of 73 cows were successfully recorded during almost 10,000 robotic milkings over a period of 5 mo. Cows were scored weekly for locomotion, and lame cows were inspected clinically for hoof lesions. Unsuccessful measurements, caused by cows standing outside the balances, were removed from the data with a special algorithm, and the mean leg loads and number of kicks during milking were calculated. To develop an expert system to automatically detect lameness cases, a model was needed, and a classifying probabilistic neural network model was chosen for the task. The data were divided into 2 parts and 5,074 measurements from 37 cows were used to train a classifying probabilistic neural network model. The operation of the model was evaluated for its ability to detect lameness in the validating data set, which had 4,868 measurements from 36 cows. The model was able to classify 96.2\% of the measurements correctly as sound or lame cows, and 100\% of the lameness cases in the validation data were identified. The number of measurements (equal to the number of milkings) causing false alarms was 1.1\%. The model developed has the potential to be used as an on-farm decision aid and can be used in a real-time lameness monitoring system.},

abstract = {This paper describes a synchronized measurement system combining image and pressure data to automatically record the angle of the metacarpus and metatarsus bones of the cow with respect to a vertical line, which is useful for lameness detection in dairy cattle. A camera system was developed to record the posture and movement of the cow and the timing and position of hoof placement and release were recorded using a pressure sensitive mat. Experiments with the automatic system were performed continuously on a farm in Ghent (Belgium) for 5 wk in September and October 2009. In total, 2,219 measurements were performed on 75 individual lactating Holstein cows. As a reference for the analysis of the calculated variables, the locomotion of the cows was visually scored from recorded videos by a trained observer into 3 classes of lameness [53.5\% were scored with gait score (GS)1, 33.3\% were scored with GS2, and 9.3\% were scored with GS3]. The contact data of the pressure mat and the camera images recorded by the system were synchronized and combined to measure different angles of the legs of the cows, together with the range of motion of the leg. Significant differences were found between the different gait scores in the release angles of the front hooves, in the range of motion of the front hooves, and in the touch angles of the hind hooves. The contact data of the pressure mat and the camera images recorded by the system were synchronized and combined to measure different angles of the legs of the cows, together with the range of motion of the leg. With respect to the classification of lameness, the range of motion of the front hooves (42.1 and 42.8\%) and the release angle of the front hooves (41.7 and 42.0\%) were important variables. In 83.3\% of the cows, a change in GS led to an increase in within-cow variance for the range of motion or the release angle of the front hooves. In 76.2\% of the cows, an increase in GS led to a decrease in range of motion or an increase in release angle of the front hooves.},

abstract = {Scoring body condition and assessing changes in the body condition of dairy cattle have become strategic tools in both farm management and research. Consequently, body condition score (BCS) is being researched extensively throughout the world. However, international sharing, comparing, and use of data generated are limited because different BCS systems exist. In the United States and Ireland a 5-point BCS system is used for dairy cows, whereas Australia and New Zealand use 8- and 10-point scales, respectively. The New Zealand 10-point scale was compared with the scoring systems in the United States, Ireland, and Australia by trained assessors. Cows were assessed visually in the United States and Australia, and in Ireland, cows were assessed by palpating key areas of the cow's body (n = 154, 110, and 120, respectively). Data were analyzed by regression. Significant positive linear relationships were found between the New Zealand 10-point scale and the other scoring systems: US 5-point scale, r(2) = 0.54; Irish 5-point scale, r(2) = 0.72; and Australian 8-point scale, r(2) = 0.61. Those relationships must be interpreted cautiously because respective BCS within a given country were by just one experienced evaluator in each country in comparison to a separate evaluator scoring all cows in all counties using the New Zealand 10-point scale. Also, few very thin or very fat cows limit evaluation across extremes of BCS. However, differences between systems were not accurately predicted by simple mathematical calculations. The relationship may be closer for New Zealand and Ireland (r(2) = 0.72) because both of those scoring systems include palpation of individual body parts, whereas visual evaluation is done in Australia and the United States. The current study is the first to examine relationships among differing BCS systems. These results may be useful for comparing/extrapolating research findings from different countries.},

abstract = {Currently, diagnosis of lameness at an early stage in dairy cows relies on visual observation by the farmer, which is time consuming and often omitted. Many studies have tried to develop automatic cow lameness detection systems. However, those studies apply thresholds to the whole population to detect whether or not an individual cow is lame. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop and test an individualized version of the body movement pattern score, which uses back posture to classify lameness into 3 classes, and to compare both the population and the individual approach under farm conditions. In a data set of 223 videos from 90 cows, 76\% of cows were correctly classified, with an 83\% true positive rate and 22\% false positive rate when using the population approach. A new data set, containing 105 videos of 8 cows that had moved through all 3 lameness classes, was used for an ANOVA on the 3 different classes, showing that body movement pattern scores differed significantly among cows. Moreover, the classification accuracy and the true positive rate increased by 10 percentage units up to 91\%, and the false positive rate decreased by 4 percentage units down to 6\% when based on an individual threshold compared with a population threshold.},
