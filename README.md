Discussion with duncan 20130222
----
- use established tools, dont try and reinvent wheel
- try to trow at wall w established techniques and see what sticks/works - harris edge detection?
- acquireing images and extracting variables will be most difficult. 
- big project but good to get into it.

### classification  methods
- he favour simple - decicion trees, PCA, LDA, clustering, KNN.

### variable creation - acwuire image then convert to list of variables for modelling.
- need to get points, then establish angles between them
- volume? 
- fat fill?
- length rib detectable?
- nedd to prescale images?

### PLAN
- try see what harris gets out of raw cow pic,
- if no good try with outline and get edges


### WUESTIONS
- how get angles inside pins?
